"It's too small to be considered a whole gauntlet. It's more like a thimble."

Introduction:
  Thimble is an action arcade game loosely based on Gauntlet(1985). In Thimble, you explore endless floors of a procedurally generated hedge maze in order to gather treasure while avoiding
  hordes of slime monsters. You start with 30 seconds to explore each floor, but killing enemies and finding helpful items can give you extra time (and sometimes even money). Make sure to
  explore as much of a floor as possible before moving on to the next, as each exit will tax you 1,000 points that you will need to offset with the treasure you've found. With that being
  said, have fun exploring Thimble. And try to get the high score!
